1
00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:06,700
According to textual evidence, Confucius compiled the Six Classics (Liu Jing) during his later years in the state of Lu,

2
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:09,200
and we all are very familiar with these books.

3
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:14,250
They are known as Shi Jing (Book of Odes), Shu Jing (Book of History), Li Jing (Book of Rites), Yuejing (Book of Music, now lost), Yi Jing (Book of Changes) and Chun Qiu (Spring and Autumn Annals).

4
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:20,900
Confucius used these Classics as teaching materials for his students.

5
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:23,800
One of these books, the Li Jing,

6
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:23,900
has been known since the Han dynasty as the Yi Li (Book of Etiquette and Ceremonial).
One of these books, the Li Jing,

7
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:28,650
has been known since the Han dynasty as the Yi Li (Book of Etiquette and Ceremonial).

8
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:37,750
This book has a total of seventeen sections

9
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:46,050
covering the rites for occasions such as coming-of-age, marriage,

10
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:49,600
drinking ceremonies, archery competitions, and so forth.

11
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:54,350
Of these, the Rites of the Provincial Archery Competition

12
00:00:55,300 --> 00:01:00,100
is our focus in a project to re-enact the rites and

13
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:02,850
to rekindle an understanding of the rites’ true significance.

14
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:04,100
Firstly

15
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:06,950
not only in China itself

16
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:09,650
but in the entire world

17
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:16,000
it is the earliest recorded form of archery competition

18
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:20,700
for which a complete textual description exists.

19
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:25,750
Previously, a number of international authorities in the field

20
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,650
have claimed that the earliest archery competition

21
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:34,000
was invented by the British nobility in the 14th century CE;

22
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:41,800
but our text dates from the late Spring and Autumn period.

23
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,200
From inscriptions on bronze vessels we know

24
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,000
that it existed much earlier in China;

25
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,350
in fact as early as the 8th century BCE

26
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:56,300
archery competitions were being held in China,

27
00:01:57,150 --> 00:02:03,500
The archery tradition in China is vastly different from that of the West

28
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:12,050
for in China archery was designed as 

29
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:16,700
a method of moral cultivation

30
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:19,600
in which one learns how to respect one’s opponent

31
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,600
and how to handle defeat.

32
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:25,000
This principle is called  “If one does not hit the target, he should seek the cause within himself.”

33
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:32,900
By re-staging this kind of competition we seek to establish their attitude

34
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,850
of how to approach one’ s life; 

35
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:37,250
how to handle one’s affairs;

36
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:40,950
how to improve one’s performance.

37
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:45,500
When the Chinese archery competition later was transmitted to Korea 

38
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,500
and to Japan

39
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,500
they also felt that there was a special kind of philosophy within it,

40
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,800
and so they did not call it the Rite of Archery
41
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,200
but rather the Way of the Bow (Kyudo)

42
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,550
believing that there was a guiding philosophical principle behind the bow and arrow 

43
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:07,250
and that they have an extremely positive significance for human development.

44
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,250
This concept is also found in the Analects of Confucius

45
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:15,100
which describes how during the archery competition the gentlemen would

46
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:18,400
“bow and yield the way to each as they ascend to the hall, and drink a salute as they descend from the hall.”

47
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,700
Confucius called this “a competition of exemplary persons”.
48
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,850
It demonstrates how in the East such kind of competition

49
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:33,350
carries within a very deep and rich civilizational connotation.

50
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:38,000
Through this re-enactment we

51
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,750
hope that many friends

52
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:46,250
will find enjoyment in the Confucian Rite of Archery

53
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:48,250
and will themselves take part

54
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:55,650
in order to personally experience its humanist significance.
